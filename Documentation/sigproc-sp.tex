% THIS IS SIGPROC-SP.TEX - VERSION 3.1
% WORKS WITH V3.2SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% APRIL 2009
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:

%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) Page numbering
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\section{Introduction}
%The \textit{proceedings} are the records of a conference.
%ACM seeks to give these conference by-products a uniform,
%high-quality appearance.  To do this, ACM has some rigid
%requirements for the format of the proceedings documents: there
%is a specified format (balanced  double columns), a specified
%set of fonts (Arial or Helvetica and Times Roman) in
%certain specified sizes (for instance, 9 point for body copy),
%a specified live area (18 $\times$ 23.5 cm [7" $\times$ 9.25"]) centered on
%the page, specified size of margins (1.9 cm [0.75"]) top, (2.54 cm [1"]) bottom
%and (1.9 cm [.75"]) left and right; specified column width
%(8.45 cm [3.33"]) and gutter size (.83 cm [.33"]).
%
%The good news is, with only a handful of manual
%settings\footnote{Two of these, the {\texttt{\char'134 numberofauthors}}
%and {\texttt{\char'134 alignauthor}} commands, you have
%already used; another, {\texttt{\char'134 balancecolumns}}, will
%be used in your very last run of \LaTeX\ to ensure
%balanced column heights on the last page.}, the \LaTeX\ document
%class file handles all of this for you.
%
%The remainder of this document is concerned with showing, in
%the context of an ``actual'' document, the \LaTeX\ commands
%specifically available for denoting the structure of a
%proceedings paper, rather than with giving rigorous descriptions
%or explanations of such commands.

\section{Concept}
\subsection{Idea}
The idea behind Bar Dude is a cocktail bar that guides people through the single steps of mixing their favourite cocktails. In a first step you are able to choose a cocktail on the website of the bar by connecting to it with your smart phone or laptop. In a second step it supports each client by illuminating the ingredients of the cocktail he or she selected step by step and by giving clear advice when you put enough of the single ingredients into the cocktail.
\subsection{Approach}

\begin{figure}[htbp] 
  \centering
     \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{pictures/bar_inventor.png}
  \caption{Sketch of the bar}
  \label{fig:bar_inventor}
\end{figure}
In our approach we planed a bar with Adobe Inventor, which was designed with two shelves each with room for six bottles. Under the lowermost shelf we planed to place the cocktail glasses, the ice bucket and the cocktail shaker. Furthermore we integrated a weight measuring module in the bottom plate of the bar, which consists of two plates with a cavity between them. This made it possible to stow all electronics inside the bar so that the user does not see any wiring unless the raspberry pi surface. On this surface we wanted to give little instructions for each step in the mixing process of the selected cocktail.

\begin{figure}[htbp] 
  \centering
     \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{pictures/technical.png}
  \caption{Technical specification}
  \label{fig:technical}
\end{figure}

\section{Hardware Construction}
\subsection{Woodwork}
After planning the rack and the shelves of the bar, we calculated the amount of wood we would need to build it. In a next step we had to cut the wood we bought into the right pieces. For the rounding of the rack bottom we contacted a local carpenter since we did not have the right instruments for doing this difficult cuts properly. The other small pieces were cut with a buzz saw as you can see in figure \ref{fig:cutting_wood}.

\begin{figure}[htbp] 
  \centering
     \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{pictures/cutting_wood.jpg}
  \caption{Cutting of the wood}
  \label{fig:cutting_wood}
\end{figure}

When all pieces of the rack were fitted, we started to assemble the rack. Therefore we used screws and wood glue so that the bar would keep stable. Figure \ref{fig:assembling} shows how the base plate is screwed together.

\begin{figure}[htbp] 
  \centering
     \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{pictures/assembling.jpg}
  \caption{Assembling of the rack}
  \label{fig:assembling}
\end{figure}

The finished framing of the rack is shown in figure \ref{fig:framing}. This picture also illustrates that we did the panelling between the two base plates with 4 mm poplar wood because this is to thin and flexible that it can be bend.

\begin{figure}[htbp] 
  \centering
     \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth, angle =270]{pictures/rack2.jpg}
  \caption{Framing of the rack}
  \label{fig:framing}
\end{figure}

For deriving a smooth surface of the rack, we filled all screw wholes with filler. Since we used plywood, we also filled the edges of the rack, so that it is easier to prime and paint the bar. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]  
  \centering
     \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{pictures/filling.jpg}
  \caption{Filling of the screw wholes}
  \label{fig:filling}
\end{figure}

In a next step we polished the bar since had to remove the needless filler and roughen the wood. This work step can be seen in figure \ref{fig:polishing}
 
\begin{figure}[htbp] 
  \centering
     \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{pictures/polishing.jpg}
  \caption{Polishing the rack}
  \label{fig:polishing}
\end{figure}

After polishing and cleaning the rack with compressed air, we were able to prime the rack. This is important since primer creates a smooth and consistent layer for the paint.

     \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth, angle =270]{pictures/rack3.jpg}

\section{Conclusions}
%This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.
%Remember that you might still have Acknowledgments or
%Appendices; brief samples of these
%follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and
%we will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception
%of the reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in
%this paper are to articles which have nothing to
%do with the present subject and are used as
%examples only.

%\section{Acknowledgments}
%This section is optional; it is a location for you
%to acknowledge grants, funding, editing assistance and
%what have you.  In the present case, for example, the
%authors would like to thank Gerald Murray of ACM for
%his help in codifying this \textit{Author's Guide}
%and the \textbf{.cls} and \textbf{.tex} files that it describes.

%%
%% The following two commands are all you need in the
%% initial runs of your .tex file to
%% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.
%\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
%\bibliography{sigproc}  % sigproc.bib is the name of the Bibliography in this case
%% You must have a proper ".bib" file
%%  and remember to run:
%% latex bibtex latex latex

%%Appendix A
%\section{Headings in Appendices}
%The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for
%the body of the article are different in the appendices.
%In the \textbf{appendix} environment, the command
%\textbf{section} is used to
%indicate the start of each Appendix, with alphabetic order
%designation (i.e. the first is A, the second B, etc.) and
%a title (if you include one).  So, if you need
%hierarchical structure
%\textit{within} an Appendix, start with \textbf{subsection} as the
%highest level. Here is an outline of the body of this
%document in Appendix-appropriate form:
%\subsection{Introduction}
%\subsection{The Body of the Paper}
%\subsubsection{Type Changes and  Special Characters}
%\subsubsection{Math Equations}
%\paragraph{Inline (In-text) Equations}
%\paragraph{Display Equations}
%\subsubsection{Citations}
%\subsubsection{Tables}
%\subsubsection{Figures}
%\subsubsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
%\subsubsection*{A Caveat for the \TeX\ Expert}
%\subsection{Conclusions}
%\subsection{Acknowledgments}
%\subsection{Additional Authors}
%This section is inserted by \LaTeX; you do not insert it.
%You just add the names and information in the
%\texttt{{\char'134}additionalauthors} command at the start
%of the document.
%\subsection{References}
%Generated by bibtex from your ~.bib file.  Run latex,
%then bibtex, then latex twice (to resolve references)
%to create the ~.bbl file.  Insert that ~.bbl file into
%the .tex source file and comment out
%the command \texttt{{\char'134}thebibliography}.
%% This next section command marks the start of
%% Appendix B, and does not continue the present hierarchy
%\section{More Help for the Hardy}
%The acm\_proc\_article-sp document class file itself is chock-full of succinct
%and helpful comments.  If you consider yourself a moderately
%experienced to expert user of \LaTeX, you may find reading
%it useful but please remember not to change it.
